# ProjectEuler
solutions to (almost) all Project Euler problems
## Project consists of two functional parts
1. Essential useful tools: mathematical algorithms (LCM, GCM, prime checking), text conversions, etc.
2. Problems' solutions.
### Each solution is an individual method that is invoked when needed.
